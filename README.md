# Bomberman
## Introduction
Everybody loves playing Bomberman. Good news. The goal of this projet is to create a full implementation of a 3D Bomberman video game.
* An overview of existing Bomberman games for inspiration: http://www.uvlist.net/groups/info/bomberman.

## Objectives
There are several distinct objectives in this project.
* Beeing able to produce a full video game, not just a pedagogical projet. This means, that the final produt should be usable by tiers, not just the students group who wrote it. One should not think "this is some early access crap" when playing your
game.
* Learning the low level use of OpenGL without the help of modern game engines, and why not start your own (tiny) little one ?
* Learning team work on a full scale project. Everybody can’t work on everything, so it’s an excellent opportunity to discover that communication, management and documentation are keys to success.
